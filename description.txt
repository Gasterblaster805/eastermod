This mod is a collection of magical items, enemies! (Boss Coming Soon!)
(Features a large group  of weapons and accesorys, most of which are in the magic damage class)
My youtube channel (linked as the mod homepage) will soon feature videos showcasing the mod.

So far I have made this all by myself, but I do want to thank all of the people giving recommendations and feedback!
